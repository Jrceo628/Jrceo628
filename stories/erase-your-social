To be a part of "Gen Z" comes with privilege and responsibility. With modern medicine, and technology, one could argue we live
in the best of times. The "youth", our young striving adults are often pointed at when the future is mentioned. We must
continue the cycle to have a better tommorrow, so that the next generation has it that much easier. Or at the very least,
has the opportunity to do so. With it being "Gen Z's" turn how well are we stacking up to our predecessors? I'm sure 
we've all encountered the stubborn oldhead who swears everything was better in his/her day. We painfully listen and 
roll our eyes but how much truth is there to be heard? The biggest change to factor (in my ever so humble opinion), lies within what 
we carry in our pockets everyday. Social media has essentially granted us unlimited access to information that is essentially
catered to us. We see what we wanna see, we hear what we wanna hear, our feed shows us only what we deem as truth. For 
some, having this unlimited access is more than dangerous. Combine that with how young most of us had this access, we 
strike disaster. Now lets reel things in here, is social media really that harmful ? It's given us tools to communicate,
research, and grow as people sure. But what about the ugly side of it ? The mindless scrolling for hours, the almost 
political aspect of keeping up with your favorite celebrity and their newest brand deal. The pressure to keep up with
what's new and trendy. We innately flock and group together to feel safe, to be apart of the crowd. This mindset can leave
most of these "oldheads" to see "Gen Z" as doomed. Honestly, I don't blame them. The facade social media creates has become
all too real the more I meet new people. I just hope we are better prepared when it's our turn to raise our youth in this age.
