          We don’t have to talk about how handsome I am but we can if you’d like. Jokes aside it’s
          surreal to be 18, to still be surrounded by family who have my well being in mind.
          Family is pretty much everything, that’s what it’s all about to me. If my mom isn’t in a

          I was Born in Far Rockaway, St. Johns Hospital to be exact.
          However, I grew up in Long Island which I’ve definitely grown to appreciate.
          This particular picture was taken when I still lived in Rockaway, it was a cramped
          apartment (from what I’ve heard) but a homey one. If you look closely theres a
          Guatemalan flag on the right side, I take great pride in my cultural background.
          Being Guatemalan and Jamaican isn’t a personality trait for me, but I do love
          the different experiences and sides of my family that come along with it
