          We don’t have to talk about how handsome I am but we can if you’d like. Jokes aside it’s
          surreal to be 18, to still be surrounded by family who have my well being in mind.
          Family is pretty much everything, that’s what it’s all about to me. If my mom isn’t in a
          Maybach when it’s all said and done, it won’t be...

        <h3>Background/Ethnicity</h3>

          I was Born in Far Rockaway, St. Johns Hospital to be exact.
          However, I grew up in Long Island which I’ve definitely grown to appreciate.
          This particular picture was taken when I still lived in Rockaway, it was a cramped
          apartment (from what I’ve heard) but a homey one. If you look closely theres a
          Guatemalan flag on the right side, I take great pride in my cultural background.
          Being Guatemalan and Jamaican isn’t a personality trait for me, but I do love
          the different experiences and sides of my family that come along with it

            See that young fly guy ?? (Some classic Jordan 14s on the feet).
            Thankfully, my parents have always kept me fly. Being fashionable has stuck with me all these years.
            I don’t think It’d be an overstatement to say buying clothes/sneakers is my guilty pleasure. 
            I’ve definitely cut back in recent years but it’s tempting to say the least. 
            In my free time I love playing basketball, doing a smooth 20mph on my longboard, and you guessed it,
            spending time with my family of course. I’ll also wash you in Super Smash Bros.

        <h3>Education/History</h3>
        <img src="images/Late Graduation.png" alt="Damn good photo">
        <p>
            This is a damn good photo lets just start off by saying that.
            I spent all my years of school within the Lawrence School District. 
            I did pretty well in school, my grades improved each year while my height saw no increase 
            (lets not talk about that). I’ve had some phenomenal teachers that have taught me much more than equations
            and who’s on the 50 dollar bill (I bet you don’t know, don’t look it up either coward). 
            My graduation was bitter sweet, I was pretty much sick and had a fever all day but still had to finish strong.
            My friends and family were all around to join the celebration. I couldn’t ask for much more than that.
